Pueblo-style architecture

At its roots, architecture exists to create the physical environment in which people live, but architecture is more than just the built environment, it's also a part of our culture. It stands as a representation of how we see ourselves, as well as how we see the world.

**Goal**
An architect once told me: When you learn about ancient cultures, the first thing people point to is their architecture, because it’s so expressive of who they were. The example they used was ancient Egypt. Take a look at the pyramids and the Sphinx, and you’ll get a good idea of how they regarded their rulers, their religion, and the qualities of the land that they drew their building materials from. The towering feats of delicate, narrative stone masonry that made up Gothic architecture, emerging in Europe in the Middle Ages, was a perfect counterpoint to its age of reverence verging on fear of divinity, during a period of grim instability. The Industrial Revolution, which re-organized the world along rational standards of machine production, inevitably birthed Modernism, which used mass-produced steel and glass to replicate this emerging order in cities. All revolutions, especially political ones, turn to architecture immediately to create their most prominent monuments. And this ability of architecture to explain its age happens whether a building is an elaborate showpiece or a banal standby.
